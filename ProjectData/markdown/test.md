## What is this? Why did I make it?
This repository is my attempt at reacreating the classic game Tetris. I tried to make my version of the game as close to the original game as I could, its not perfect, but I can still improve it over time. I made it because I felt like giving myself a challenge and it's honestly just a fun game and now I can play my own version of it whenever I want to. It was a fun adventure making this.

## Can I play this?
Yeah of course! Just follow the steps for installing it on your own computer!
- Make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) V15.4.0 or higher or you may encounter errors.
- Make sure you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed on your computer and it is properly set up in your PATH.
- I would highly recommend using either the [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/Maxisthemoose/console-tetris), as it supports the rendering of emojis in the window, or finding a terminal that will correctly render emojis. If you dont do so, you will be very underwhelmed with the results.

```cmd
$ git clone https://github.com/Maxisthemoose/console-tetris.git
$ cd console-tetris
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

## What are the controls?
To move the pieces left and right, use the A and D keys. To hard drop a piece, press the down arrow. To move a piece down faster, use the S key. To rotate the pieces left and right, use the Left and Right arrow keys. Press the F key to place the current piece in the "Hold" position to use it at a later time.

#### Updates
- Added Music! When the game starts, you should now be able to hear the original Tetris Theme! And when the game ends, you should now be able to hear the original Tetris Game Over Theme! I have also added the clear sound effect!
- Added the rest of the SFX! Piece Move, Piece Rotate, Piece Drop/Place, Normal Clear, Tetris Clear, and also raised the volume of some clips.
- Added Level Up sound effects! Score multiplier on level increase.
- Added the ability to "hold" pieces to be used at a later time.

And that should basically be it! Enjoy your classic game of Tetris!
